# musubi-iOS

Musubi is a prototype iOS client for Spork, a full-stack project that enables Spotify users to version control playlists and collaborate using forks.

Note that this particular prototype only offers the simplest possible merge conflict resolution strategy (choose one version to "keep" and optionally stash-commit the other). This means fork-based collaboration is unavailable in this prototype. Note that the underlying mechanisms for granular merging and collaboration have been [developed and mock-tested](https://github.com/sporkful/diffuse-swift) - the main remaining challenge is designing the three-pane UI given the smaller form factor of mobile devices.
